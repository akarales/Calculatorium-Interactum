6. Calculus I - Limits and Derivatives
7. Calculus II - Integrals and Applications
8. Calculus III - Multivariable Calculus
9. Linear Algebra Fundamentals
10. Probability and Statistics

## Course Components

Each course in the series includes:

1. **01_lessons**: Comprehensive coverage of topics with examples and illustrations
2. **02_quiz_book**: Regular assessments to check understanding
3. **03_reinforcement_workbook**: Hands-on problem-solving exercises for deep understanding and long-term retention
4. **04_interactive_visualizations**: Dynamic, interactive plots and diagrams to aid comprehension
5. **05_midterm_exam**: Comprehensive assessment of the first half of the course
6. **06_final_exam**: Comprehensive assessment covering all course material
7. **07_use_cases**: Real-world applications and projects demonstrating practical relevance
8. **rule_key.txt**: Summary of key concepts, formulas, and rules

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning Algorithms**: Embedded in lesson notebooks to adjust difficulty based on student performance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and diagrams allow students to explore concepts visually and interactively.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Key concepts are reinforced through repeated hands-on problem-solving exercises.
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Each course includes practical projects demonstrating real-world applications.
- **Educator Support**: Dedicated teachers workbook provides guidance and answers for effective instruction.

## Learning Methodology

Calculatorium Interactum employs a unique learning strategy:

1. **Concept Introduction**: Each new concept is thoroughly explained in the lessons.
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Students engage with interactive visualizations to build intuition.
3. **Initial Practice**: Students attempt related problems in the Quiz Book.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Lesson notebooks adjust difficulty based on student performance.
5. **Deep Reinforcement**: The Reinforcement Workbook provides repeated hands-on problem-solving exercises.
6. **Practical Application**: Use cases demonstrate real-world applications of the concepts.
7. **Comprehensive Review**: Midterm and Final Exams assess overall understanding.
8. **Quick Reference**: The Rule Key serves as a concise summary for review and reference.

## Language Library

The `shared-resources/language-examples/` directory contains implementations of key mathematical concepts in various programming languages. This allows students to compare and contrast different approaches and choose the language that best suits their needs or interests. Each language subdirectory contains examples organized by mathematical topic.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Calculatorium-Interactum.git
   ```
2. Install required software: Python, Jupyter, and other necessary tools (Haskell, R, Julia, C, C++, Rust compilers, Node.js as needed).
3. Navigate to the desired course and start with the lessons in the `01_lessons` directory.
4. Use Jupyter Notebook to open and interact with the lesson files.
