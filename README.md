7. Calculus II - Integrals and Applications
8. Calculus III - Multivariable Calculus
9. Linear Algebra Fundamentals
10. Probability and Statistics

## Course Components

Each course in the series includes:

1. **01_lessons**: Comprehensive coverage of topics with examples and illustrations
2. **02_quiz_book**: Regular assessments to check understanding
3. **03_reinforcement_workbook**: Hands-on problem-solving exercises for deep understanding and long-term retention
4. **04_interactive_visualizations**: Dynamic, interactive plots and diagrams to aid comprehension
5. **05_midterm_exam**: Comprehensive assessment of the first half of the course
6. **06_final_exam**: Comprehensive assessment covering all course material
7. **07_use_cases**: Real-world applications and projects demonstrating practical relevance
8. **rule_key.pdf**: LaTeX-generated PDF summarizing key concepts, formulas, and rules

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and diagrams allow students to explore concepts visually and interactively.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Key concepts are reinforced through repeated hands-on problem-solving exercises.
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Each course includes practical projects demonstrating real-world applications.
- **Educator Support**: Dedicated teachers workbook provides guidance and answers for effective instruction.

## Learning Methodology

Calculatorium Interactum employs a unique learning strategy:

1. **Concept Introduction**: Each new concept is thoroughly explained in the lessons.
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Students engage with interactive visualizations to build intuition.
3. **Initial Practice**: Students attempt related problems in the Quiz Book.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Lesson notebooks adjust difficulty based on student performance.
5. **Deep Reinforcement**: The Reinforcement Workbook provides repeated hands-on problem-solving exercises.
6. **Practical Application**: Use cases demonstrate real-world applications of the concepts.
7. **Comprehensive Review**: Midterm and Final Exams assess overall understanding.
8. **Quick Reference**: The Rule Key serves as a concise summary for review and reference.
